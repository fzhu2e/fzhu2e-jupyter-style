# fzhu2e Jupyter Style

This is my customized Jupyter notebook style.

## How to use
Download or clone this repo, then
```bash
make basic
```
to install the style.

If you want to have Vim key-binding feature, continue
```bash
make vim
```

Or one can just
```bash
make vim
```
in the very first beginning.


## How to remove
Under the repo folder, run
```bash
make clean
```
